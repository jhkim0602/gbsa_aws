# Tasks: Interview Evidence Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-interview-evidence-platform/`

**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](./plan.md), [spec.md](./spec.md), [research.md](./research.md),
[data-model.md](./data-model.md), [contracts/](./contracts/),
[parallel-workstreams.md](./parallel-workstreams.md)

**Tests**: Required by Constitution Principle IV. For each domain rule or contract, commit the test
before or with implementation and observe it fail against the previous state.

**Organization**: Setup and Foundation are integration-owned. After `foundation-v1`, US1/US2/US3/US4
map one-to-one to Lane A/B/C/D and run in four worktrees.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel because it writes a different owned file and has no incomplete dependency.
- **[Story]**: User story mapping for traceability.
- Every description names the owner, requirement/gate coverage and an exact file path.

## Phase 1: Setup (Integration Owner)

**Purpose**: Create the shared monorepo skeleton without implementing domain behavior.

- [X] T001 Integration — Define JavaScript workspaces and root scripts in `package.json`
- [X] T002 [P] Integration — Define the locked Python workspace, FastAPI and test dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [X] T003 [P] Integration — Define local PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, S3/SQS emulation and search services in `compose.yaml`
- [X] T004 Integration — Add the documented bootstrap, generation and test entry points to `Makefile`
- [X] T005 [P] Integration — Document safe local configuration with no credentials in `.env.example`
- [X] T006 [P] Integration — Scaffold the company Vite application and feature slots in `apps/company-console/package.json`
- [X] T007 [P] Integration — Scaffold the applicant Vite application and feature slots in `apps/applicant-interview/package.json`
- [X] T008 [P] Integration — Scaffold the Python package and API/worker entry points in `backend/src/interview_evidence/__init__.py`
- [X] T009 [P] Lane A — Create the approved Terraform directory roots in `infra/README.md` (PD-26, QG-16)
- [X] T010 [P] Integration — Create shared end-to-end, fixture, regression and load test roots in `tests/README.md`
- [X] T011 [P] Integration — Configure editor, Markdown, Python, TypeScript and Terraform formatting in `.editorconfig`
- [X] T012 [P] Integration — Add API and worker container build targets in `backend/Containerfile`
- [X] T013 Integration — Document directory ownership and local setup in `README.md`
- [X] T014 Integration — Add baseline format, type, unit and artifact-drift jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Checkpoint**: All planned paths exist; no domain behavior has been implemented.

---

## Phase 2: Foundation (Blocks All Four Lanes)

**Purpose**: Freeze contracts, shared primitives, fakes, migration rules and CI before branching.

**Critical**: Complete and review `checklists/parallel-readiness.md`, then tag one common
`foundation-v1` commit. No lane branches from an earlier commit.

- [X] T015 Integration — Copy and split the canonical REST contract into lane fragments under `packages/contracts/openapi/root.yaml` (FR-005, QG-04)
- [X] T016 [P] Integration — Encode the WebSocket envelope and message schemas in `packages/contracts/events/websocket/v1/` (FR-032-FR-035, QG-08)
- [X] T017 [P] Integration — Encode the async envelope and domain event schemas in `packages/contracts/events/common/v1/envelope.json` (FR-050)
- [X] T018 Integration — Generate and commit Python/TypeScript contract types from canonical schemas in `packages/contracts/generated/README.md`
- [X] T019 Integration — Add generated-type and canonical-contract drift tests in `backend/tests/contract/test_generated_contract_drift.py`

- [X] T021 [P] Integration — Implement required TenantContext and scope guards in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/tenant.py` (FR-005, QG-04)
- [X] T022 [P] Integration — Implement the safe error envelope and error catalog in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/errors.py` (FR-049)
- [X] T023 [P] Integration — Implement typed configuration with secret-safe rendering in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/config.py` (FR-049)

- [X] T025 [P] Integration — Define storage, queue, AI, search, speech and email ports plus fakes in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/aws_clients/ports.py`
- [X] T026 Integration — Implement OutboxEvent and ProcessedMessage primitives in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/messaging/outbox.py` (FR-032, FR-050)

- [X] T029 Integration — Add lane-head, prefix, downgrade and ORM drift validation in `scripts/check_migrations.sh` (QG-16)
- [X] T030 [P] Integration — Add forbidden cross-module import rules in `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py`
- [X] T031 [P] Integration — Create tenant, criterion, invitation, strategy, session and report contract fixtures in `tests/fixtures/shared/factories.py`
- [X] T032 Integration — Create root router composition without domain-private imports in `backend/src/interview_evidence/main.py`
- [X] T033 [P] Integration — Create feature-route registries for both SPAs in `apps/company-console/src/app/featureRoutes.ts` and `apps/applicant-interview/src/app/featureRoutes.ts`
- [X] T034 Integration — Add structured logging, trace propagation and prohibited-field tests in `backend/src/interview_evidence/shared/observability.py` (FR-049, FR-051)
- [X] T035 Integration — Add the complete foundation gate and tag verification in `scripts/verify_foundation.sh`

**Checkpoint**: Contract generation is clean, fakes conform, boundary and migration checks pass, and
all four worktrees can start from the same `foundation-v1` commit.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 Setup**: starts immediately; Integration Owner coordinates root files.
- **Phase 2 Foundation**: depends on Setup and blocks all user-story implementation.
- **Phases 3-6**: start simultaneously from the same `foundation-v1` commit:
  - Phase 3 / US1 = Lane A
  - Phase 4 / US2 = Lane B
  - Phase 5 / US3 = Lane C
  - Phase 6 / US4 = Lane D
- **Phase 7 Integration**: lane work may be reviewed while others continue, but the merge train
  follows A → B → C → D.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 / Lane A**: no runtime dependency on other stories; uses report/analysis/interview projections as fakes.
- **US2 / Lane B**: consumes frozen campaign/criterion/consent contracts; can finish against fixtures.
- **US3 / Lane C**: consumes frozen strategy/retrieval contracts; can finish against fixtures.
- **US4 / Lane D**: consumes frozen Turn/media/source contracts; can finish against fixtures.
- Real producer replacement occurs only in T172-T175, after each producing lane merges.

### Within Each Lane

1. Complete and observe failing contract/domain tests.
2. Add the lane-prefixed migration and domain models.
3. Implement repositories and adapters behind frozen ports.
4. Implement application services and policy rules.
5. Implement route/event fragments and owned UI.
6. Run the lane quickstart against fakes.
7. Update from the integration branch and run the same tests against real merged producers.

## Parallel Opportunities

- T002-T012 are independent setup files after T001 defines root conventions.
- T016-T017 and T020-T025 are independent foundation artifacts before composition tasks.
- After T035, all tasks in Phases 3, 4, 5 and 6 run as four parallel workstreams.
- Within a lane, test files marked [P] can be authored in parallel before implementation.
- Domain model files marked [P] are exclusive and can be implemented after their tests exist.
- T160-T167 Terraform modules are independent; only T168 composes them.
- T179-T185 are independent cross-cutting test/data artifacts before the final report.

## Four-Person Invocation

After the start gate is reviewed, each person opens their worktree and gives Codex one bounded task:

```text
Person 1 / Lane A:
$speckit-implement Implement only unchecked tasks whose description starts "Lane A —" in
specs/001-interview-evidence-platform/tasks.md. Do not edit integration-owned or other-lane paths.

Person 2 / Lane B:
$speckit-implement Implement only unchecked tasks whose description starts "Lane B —" in
specs/001-interview-evidence-platform/tasks.md. Use frozen fakes for unmerged producers.

Person 3 / Lane C:
$speckit-implement Implement only unchecked tasks whose description starts "Lane C —" in
specs/001-interview-evidence-platform/tasks.md. Use frozen fakes for unmerged producers.

Person 4 / Lane D:
$speckit-implement Implement only unchecked tasks whose description starts "Lane D —" in
specs/001-interview-evidence-platform/tasks.md. Use frozen fakes for unmerged producers.
```

The Integration Owner handles only tasks whose description starts `Integration —`; this role does
not authorize edits to a lane's exclusive implementation path.

## Parallel Example

```text
After foundation-v1:
  Worktree A -> T036-T063
  Worktree B -> T064-T093
  Worktree C -> T094-T130
  Worktree D -> T131-T159

Review can happen in any order.
Merge and real-adapter replacement happen A -> B -> C -> D using T171-T178.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Thin Slice First

Each lane first implements the smallest path needed by its independent test:

- Lane A: criterion version → campaign → invitation → consent.
- Lane B: submitted fixtures → source retrieval → strategy.
- Lane C: start → answer → next question → reconnect → complete.
- Lane D: completed fixture → Evidence report → human decision → deletion.

Only after all four thin slices pass should a lane add breadth such as CSV scale, deeper Git context,
additional degraded modes or richer review UI.

### Merge Discipline

- One task or tightly coupled test/implementation pair per commit.
- Every PR lists lane, foundation hash, task IDs, FR/SC/QG IDs, contracts and migration head.
- No lane PR edits `tasks.md`, generated output, a shared root or another lane path.
- Shared contract changes merge separately before consumer implementation.
- A completed task checkbox is updated on the integration branch after its commit is accepted.
- Final completion requires the merged quickstart and convergence pass, not four isolated green lanes.
